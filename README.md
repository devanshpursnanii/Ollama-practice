# Ollama LLM Projects

This repository contains my hands-on work from the **Ollama LLM Deep Dive Course**, where I explored building AI applications locally using Ollama models.

## Course Highlights
- Setup Ollama and explored its CLI & Python library.
- Pulled and tested different LLMs (like LLaMA3, Llava Multimodal).
- Built a **Grocery List Organizer** AI app.
- Developed a **PDF RAG System** with Vector DB & embeddings.
- Created a **Streamlit frontend** for interacting with models.

## Features
- Run LLMs locally (no external APIs required).
- Custom Modelfiles for tailored behavior.
- REST API integration with Python.
- Streamlit web apps for user-friendly interfaces.
